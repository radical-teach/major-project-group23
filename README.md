Project Problem #6 - Rutgers RoutePlanner System: \
OptimalDelivery is a logistics company that wants to move shipments from Producer to Consumer in a distance-optimal manner. 
They approach your team to help them design a route planning system that enables their fleet of T trucks to pick up from P (predetermined) pickup 
points, and deliver to D receiving points, so as to incur minimum gas costs, i.e., the fleet has to drive minimum distance collectively.
